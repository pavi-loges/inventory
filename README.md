# Inventory

## Problem/Opportunity
Inventory states is a complex project, which requires a lot of great discussions and decisions to be made. Currently, we don't have a central space where they are organized and easy to find. We use slack to have discussions where conversations occur in multiple spaces and can be easily lost, and then use google docs to document them. Unfortunately, with google docs organizing is cumbersome. Often, a doc is created in the owner's drive and it will get lost in the muddle since it wasn't added to a shared drive. This leads to low transparency, as new team members and other teams will either have to ask us the same questions and struggle to easily find the context they need. 

For example: Let's say Tobi wants to understand what discussion led to a particular decision or direction on the project. How will he easily find that information without having to specifically reach out to our team and setting up a meeting?

Github is a global tool which we use at Shopify. Unlike google docs, github is organized for everyone already. Since github uses commits, it's easier to track discussion and decision changes and updates. Futhermore, there's the potential to further extend this tool as a source of truth where it's sole purpose is for documentation of all project related items (E.g. ideas, designs, etc.). As opposed to us having a doc of docs which leads us to 20 different items, and having to send repetitive links to these items every time there's a question. We can have a central space where all of this information exists and set an example for other teams to adopt.

## Why is this worth solving?
Overall, this will help speed up team alignment and avoid wasting time sifting through docs, slack or multiple tools to find past decisions or discussions. This means a better way of GSD.   

1. A source of truth and central space for us to track our discussions/descisions, and see what requires follow-up 
2. Transparency for all
3. Easily find past decisions or discussions for reference


## Success criteria
1. When we're spending less time looking for notes and docs
2. Reduced repetitive conversation in slack due to conversations being lost
3. Increased transparency across external teams and a reduced need for more meetings as a result
4. Moving forward quicker with follow-ups as they're documented
5. Increased team alignment


## Tripwires
1. Forgetting to document and update items/assets here
   
   This can be avoided if we set up a reminder/notification, as well as adopt the practice collectively to refer to this repo for all project related items.

## Dependencies
Team as a whole will need to document and maintain. We need to hold ourselves accountable.

## Implementation plan
1. Store this repo in the appropriate place
2. Document our current discussions, decisions, assets
3. Set up follow-ups on project board
4. Set up notifications/reminders to review and update github on a regular basis
5. Trial this method for a couple weeks to a month to see how it works for the team.
